# elgentos Mailcheck
This is the [Mailcheck](https://github.com/mailcheck/mailcheck) extension for Magento. It checks the users input in the email field for common typo mistakes in the domain part.

There are a number of default domains such as gmail.com and hotmail.com. The extension supplements these with the most commonly used domains in your Magento store. The cut off point of the number occurences it needs to add it to the domain list is configurable (defaults to 50).

Configuration can be found under System > Configuration > Customer > Customer Configuration > Mailcheck.
